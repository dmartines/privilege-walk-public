# Privilege Walk
The privilege walk exercise that examines the intricacies of privilege in our society. It explores how we enjoy or do not enjoy privileges during our interactions at work and personal life. The exercise can be done individually or as groups. For group exercises it is important to ensure trust and respect, as the exercise will highlight privilege differences within the group. 

The exercise is not meant to make anyone feel guilty nor exacerbate division in a group. Instead it is meant to bring awareness of disparities within group dynamics and help teams learn how to work better with each other. By educating people on privilege we can identify ways to work and collaborate more inclusively, with deeper awareness of one's intersectionality.
